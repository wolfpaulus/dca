# CI/CD
## Local Repository
### Github Action
 The ./github/workflows directory contains three workflows:
 1. python-test
 1. azure-deploy
 1. docker-publish

#### python-test
This workflow runs everytime a commit is pushed to github.
Should autopep8 linting succeed, pytest runs. Only if pytest succeeds without failiures will the other two workflows run.

#### azure-deply 
This workflow will deploy the python app on Azure.
- Edit the ```.github/workflows/azure_deploy.yml``` file. Set the AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME environment variable to your web app's name.
E.g.: AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME: 'webApp-rh5dsxbm77scq'
- Add, Commit, and Push, to trigger the workflow
