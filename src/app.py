        Automatic investing is a strategy for steadily building wealth,
        often implemented through Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA).
        This approach involves investing a fixed dollar amount at regular intervals,
        allowing investors to buy more shares when prices are low and fewer shares
        when prices are high.
        Alternatively, investors can opt to buy a fixed quantity of shares at regular
        intervals. Here we simulate both strategies using five years of
        historical stock market data, provided by Yahoo Finance.
